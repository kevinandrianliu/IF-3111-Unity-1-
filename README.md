## Notes
1. Due to my error, I've committed several times in my gitlab. Hereby is the link : https://gitlab.informatika.org/kevinandrianliu/unity_week1_13516118.  
2. I use WebGL in Unity 2018 version 3.5, so the files are much higher than the Web Player suggested in the video. In order to play the game, double click the index.html file in build folder.  
3. There are some changes from the video, due to the obsolete methods(for example I use ScreenManager and getComponent<Class_Name> and Text instead of GUIText).
4. I use https://oc.unity3d.com/index.php/s/rna2inqWBBysn6l to address some of the differences, although in the UI I mix between the video and the upgrade documentation tutorial.
